==========================
  My Emacs.d configuration
==========================

As my editor of choice I run Emacs. One of the benefits of Emacs is that it'll install basically anywhere.

This configuration is designed to run in shells as well as on desktops. There are some platform specific optimisations as well.

Installing this Emacs
=====================

Just check it out straight to the right directory, and use Make to install it:

::

    make install
